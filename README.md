# SNS-DOS
SNS-DOS is the command-line "OS", that is designed differently.
As example - SnsVM that runs SNS-DOS on SNS-DOS. And, themes or time?
This project is originally intended for Windows.
> * ### Windows version requirement:
>   * ### Windows: 10/11 or newer (or .NET Framework 4.x)
>   * CPU Architecture: x64/ARM64
> * Notice: this one is under rewrite, so the version numeration would be different
