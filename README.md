# SNS-DOS
SNS-DOS is the command-line "OS", that is designed differently.
As example - SnsVM that runs SNS-DOS on SNS-DOS. And, themes or time?
This project is originally intended for Windows.
> * ### Windows version requirement:
> * Minimal: Windows 8(.x)
> * **Recommended: Windows 10 Version 1809 or newer**
> * * SNS-DOS Codename `deer` requirements:
>   * * ### Windows: 10/11 21H2 or newer (or .NET Framework 4.8.1+)
>     * ### CPU Architecture: x64
> * Notice: Some dialogs are relying on VBScript. So, if you don't have added VBScript scripting component in UWP Settings app, then SNS-DOS will still run fine, but not SnsCritical.
